** TODO Simulate single plant species/functional group [3/4] :initialization:
Organisms are stored in an array of n_frags (read from simulation file). All organisms are stored in this array and are updated together (each fragment - it could be possible to have simulations where there is some desynchronization between fragments!).
*newOrg()* will have multiple methods: One for initialization, where individuals always establish and another where it depends on the individuals fitness in the grid and establishment!() is called.  
 - [X] Initialize a certain number of organisms
   - [X] get fct types and abundances from input file
   - [X] create orgs somewhere ('organisms' Array)
   - [X] properly index individuals in the WordCell landscape
     - [X] create bunch of locations and draw from them CLOSED <2018-02-21 Mi>
     - [X] all cells get the same quantity (init_abund) of organisms, the locations are rdm, though. The loop inside XYs is causing it. --> because the *landscape.orgs* field was initialized with empty orgs, *push!()* would add the same orgs to  all the cells! Individuals are now stored in *orgs* array, instead. Even ig that is not the real problem, it makes indexation easier CLOSED <2018-02-22 Do>
     - [X] create different arrays for different fct groups: For now, not necessary, as functional group should be available as field of orgs array. CLOSED <2018-02-23 Fr> 
 - [X] correct IDcounter: global in Organisms module, exported and called in newOrgs!()
 - [X] check ERROR with method on function newOrgs(): why push! nao funciona? Because all arry's contents had been initialized at the same time <2018-02-26 Mo>.
 - [ ] Simulate single functional group
   - [ ] reproduction: pollinator independent = use reproduction probability
   - [ ] wind reproduction (see *reproduction()*): Bullock et al. 2017

*** OrgsRef: [1/2] 
- [ ] come up with structure (dict or composite type) to store the parameters of different species/fgroups, instead of tables?
- [X] How to store multiple types of organisms: single array. Might be necessary to chage it, if calling specific fct types reveals itself to be important and can't be done otherwise
- Eventhough they are more rigid, structs are easier to call and the fields have more flexibility to store different kinds of information on the functional group parameters

** Life-cycle
*** TODO Check MTE units & probabilities!!!
    DEADLINE: <2018-03-23 Fr>
*** TODO Compete [4/5]
 Competition is biomass-based: overlap of area gives rise to /compterm/ that penalizes growth
 - [X] Vegetative biomass is projected to calculate competition /compterm/: *projectvegmass!()*
Projection outside boundaries are not being taken into account: *edge effects* come up, because "realized biomass" i smaller
 - [ ] The landscape cell has biomass carrying capacity of each /.fgroup/ it can sustain. If that max is attained, the organism in question DOES WHAT? HOW IT CAN BE PENALIZED?
 - [X] Initialize a 'competition landscape' for the plants: /.neighs/ field in the landscape holds a dictionnary with sum of biomass projected by each individual of a functional group
 - [X] Competition arises form growth rate being penalized by overlapping 
 - [X] When competition is too strong (/compterm/ <= 1) individual has an increased probability of dying 
*** DONE Growth

*** TODO Allocation [2/3]
    DEADLINE: <2018-03-28 Mi>
- [-] Divide biomass GAIN according to allocation to survival, growth and reproduction. The allocation will depend on the stage:
  - [X] sorts things into the individual's /biomass/ Dictionnary
  For _embryos_:
  - [ ] Only consume reserve = decrease biomass
      SCHEDULED: <2018-03-18 So>
  For _juveniles_:
  - Biomass goes into /growth/ dictionnary entry: this is used in *projvegmass!()* for plants
  For _adults_:
  - Biomass goes into /reprod/ dictionnary entry: this is used in *projrepmass!()* for plants
  - [ ] TODO Only exists during reproductive season, controlled by *age* and *fgroup* (gives the duration of reproductive season): for annuals, it should arise from stage transitions, but how about perennials?
      SCHEDULED: <2018-03-18 So>
- [X] Biomass gain depends on competition: normalize *compterm* 
- [X] *allocation()* disentangled from *survive!()*, which is based on whole body mass. The MTE is based on dry weights, which means that underlying energetic budget doesn't need to be taking into account if the most important functions in the model (growth and reprodction), can be modelled via the biomass allocated to those structures. Other life-history traits, such as survival, will depend on the resulting total biomass. *Resistance structures are NOT being taken into account*, any accumulatiion of biomass should reflect in the mass-dependent survival function. 
**** TODO Complex allocation
- [ ] The allocation rules should give rise to the appropriate growth curve (von Bertalanfy for insects, for example)
Parameters values might be specific to each functional group, but general mechanism must be the same fo plants and insects, at least.
